Here's a sample README file for your `SearchBar` component:

# SearchBar Component
================

## Overview
The `SearchBar` component is a reusable React component that provides a search input field with debouncing functionality. It uses the `useDebounce` custom hook to delay the update of the search value, preventing excessive API calls.

## Usage
Here are two use cases for the `SearchBar` component:

### Use Case 1: Search API
The `SearchBar` component can be used to search for data in a database or API. When the user types in the search input field, the debounced value can be used to trigger a search API call after a delay of 500 milliseconds. This prevents excessive API calls and improves the overall performance of the application.

### Use Case 2: Filtering Data
The `SearchBar` component can be used to filter data in a table or list. When the user types in the search input field, the debounced value can be used to filter the data in real-time. This provides a smooth and responsive user experience.
```
### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SearchBar from './SearchBar';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Search Example</h1>
      <SearchBar />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```



## Functionality
- The `SearchBar` component renders an input field of type "text".
- The input value is controlled by the `inputValue` state, which is initialized as an empty string.
- When the user types in the input field, the `onChange` event updates the `inputValue` state with the new value.
- The `useDebounce` hook is used to debounce the `inputValue` state with a delay of 500 milliseconds. This means that the debounced value will only update after a 500ms delay since the last change to the input value.
- The debounced value can be used for further processing, such as triggering a search API call or filtering data.
